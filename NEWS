rmda v 1.6
========================
* update default y-axis limits for sNB plots to show positive values only. 
* print a message warning of bias due to overfitting when the same data is used to fit and evaluate a model using decision_curve. 
* fix a bug where CI's for the policy of treating 'None' were not plotted or printed using summary when policy = "opt-out". 

rmda v 1.5
========================
* Update the cost:benefit axes labels for decision curves generated for an 'opt-out' treatment policy so that the definition of costs and benefits are consistent for opt-out vs. opt-in policies. 


rmda v1.4
========================
*Package has changed names to rmda (risk model data analysis).  

v 1.4
========================
* Version 1.4 of the package provides an alternative framing of the decision problem for situations where treatment is the standard-of-care and a risk model might be used in order for low-risk patients (i.e., patients below some risk threshold) to opt out of treatment. This is implemented in the package with the addition of the 'policy' argument to function decision_curve.


v 1.3
========================
* fixed bug in the inputs for createFolds for cv_decision_curve.

* allowed for multiple curves to be plotted together when one curve has CI’s and the other doesn’t
